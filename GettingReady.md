# Getting Ready - Training for the Big Match, Brother! 🤼‍♂️

## Step 1: Set up your GitHub.com account - Sign Your Wrestling Contract!

For this class, we're gonna use a public account on GitHub.com, brotha! We do this for a few reasons, and let me tell you what, jack:

We don't want you to "practice" in repositories that contain real code - that's like practicing your leg drop on a real champion, brother!
We are going to break some things so we can teach you how to fix them (just like learning to take bumps in the ring in '84, brotha!).

You can set up your free account by following these steps, brother:

* Access [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and click Sign up (Enter the arena!)
* Choose the free account (Everyone gets a shot at the championship!)
* You will receive a verification email at the address provided (Your official invitation to Hulkamania!)
* Click the link to complete the verification process (Accept the challenge, brother!)
* If you already have an account, verify that you can visit github.com within your organization's network (Make sure the ropes aren't blocking you, brotha!)

GitHub is designed to run on the current versions of all major browsers, brother! Just like how Hulkamania ran wild on all the networks in the 80s and 90s! Take a look at our list of supported browsers, jack!
